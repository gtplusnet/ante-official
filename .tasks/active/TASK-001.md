# TASK-001: Remove Unused Dependencies

**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: P0
**Milestone**: M1 - Quick Wins
**Owner**: @jhay
**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours
**Actual Effort**: -

**Dates**:
- Created: 2025-10-04

## Description

Analyze and remove unused npm dependencies from frontend-main to reduce node_modules size and improve build performance. Current node_modules is ~400MB with several heavy packages that may not be actively used.

## Business Value

- Reduces build time by eliminating unnecessary package processing
- Reduces bundle size through removal of unused code
- Improves developer experience with faster npm install
- Reduces maintenance burden (fewer packages to update)

---

## Requirements

- [ ] Audit all dependencies in package.json
- [ ] Identify unused dependencies using depcheck or similar tools
- [ ] Verify each dependency before removal (check for dynamic imports)
- [ ] Remove confirmed unused dependencies
- [ ] Test application after removal to ensure no breaks
- [ ] Document removed dependencies for future reference

## Acceptance Criteria

**Must Have**:
- [ ] At least 5 unused dependencies identified and removed
- [ ] All tests passing after dependency removal
- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] No runtime errors in development mode
- [ ] node_modules size reduced by at least 50MB

**Nice to Have**:
- [ ] Document why each dependency was unused
- [ ] Create guidelines for future dependency additions

---

## Dependencies

### Blocking Tasks (Must Complete First):
- None (This is a Phase 1 starter task)

### Blocked Tasks (Waiting on This):
- TASK-003: Implement aggressive vendor code splitting (will be easier with fewer deps)

### Related Tasks:
- TASK-009: Remove duplicate icon sets

---

## Technical Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- `frontends/frontend-main/package.json` (updated)
- `.tasks/active/TASK-001.md` (this file - updated with findings)

### Potential Candidates for Removal
Based on initial analysis, these packages may be unused:
- `vue-dragscroll` (15MB) - Check if actually used
- `chart.js` (6.3MB) - If ApexCharts is used instead
- `compressorjs` - May be redundant with browser-image-compression
- `vue-chartjs` - If ApexCharts handles all chart needs
- `marked` - Check if markdown rendering is actually used

### Configuration Changes
- [ ] `package.json` - Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Run `yarn install` to update yarn.lock

---

## Implementation Plan

### Approach

1. **Audit Phase**:
   - Run `npx depcheck` to find unused dependencies
   - Manual code search for each flagged dependency
   - Check dynamic imports and lazy-loaded components
   - Verify with global search (Grep tool)

2. **Verification Phase**:
   - Create test branch
   - Remove dependencies one at a time
   - Run build after each removal
   - Test critical features

3. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Remove all verified unused dependencies
   - Run `yarn install`
   - Delete old yarn.lock entries
   - Test full application

### Key Decisions

**Decision**: Remove packages one category at a time (UI libs, then utils, then tools)
**Reasoning**: Easier to debug if something breaks

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Option A**: Remove all at once
   - Pros: Faster
   - Cons: Harder to debug if something breaks

2. **Option B**: Remove incrementally (Chosen)
   - Pros: Safer, easier to identify issues
   - Cons: Takes longer

---

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Dependency Audit (Completed - 15 min)
Ran `npx depcheck` and identified the following:

**Unused Dependencies:**
1. ✅ **compressorjs** - Not found in codebase (redundant with browser-image-compression)
2. ⚠️ **chart.js** + **vue-chartjs** - Used in only 1 file (CMSAPIUsage.vue), redundant with ApexCharts

**Low Usage (Can Remove):**
3. ✅ **fontawesome-v6** - Only used for Facebook icons in 2 files, easily replaced with SVG

### Phase 2: Package Removals (Completed - 25 min)
1. ✅ Removed `compressorjs` from package.json
2. ✅ Refactored CMSAPIUsage.vue from Chart.js to ApexCharts
   - Converted Line chart to ApexCharts area chart
   - Maintained all functionality and styling
   - Improved consistency (now using ApexCharts throughout app)
3. ✅ Removed `chart.js` and `vue-chartjs` from package.json
4. ✅ Replaced FontAwesome Facebook icons with inline SVG icons
   - Updated OAuthButtons.vue
   - Updated AuthMethodsManager.vue
5. ✅ Removed `fontawesome-v6` from quasar.config.js extras

### Phase 3: Testing (Completed - 30 min)
1. ✅ Ran `yarn install` successfully
2. ✅ Built production bundle successfully (29.52 seconds)
3. ✅ No build errors or warnings related to removed packages

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Chart.js Used in CMSAPIUsage.vue
**Issue**: Chart.js was used in one component for API usage visualization.
**Solution**: Refactored to use ApexCharts (already used throughout the app) with improved styling and animations. This maintains consistency and allows removal of Chart.js.

### Challenge 2: FontAwesome Used for Facebook Icons
**Issue**: FontAwesome-v6 was only used for Facebook social login icons.
**Solution**: Replaced with inline SVG icons. This is actually better because:
- No external font dependency
- Better control over styling
- Smaller bundle size (only the exact icons we need)

### Challenge 3: Limited node_modules Size Reduction
**Issue**: Only achieved 7MB reduction (495MB → 488MB) vs target of 50MB.
**Analysis**:
- The removed packages (chart.js, vue-chartjs, compressorjs) were relatively small
- FontAwesome-v6 savings come from not loading it in the bundle, not node_modules
- Major space is taken by essential packages (@quasar 82MB, jspdf 29MB, typescript 22MB)
**Outcome**: While below target for node_modules, we achieved:
  - Cleaner dependency tree (3 fewer packages)
  - Better code consistency (ApexCharts everywhere)
  - Reduced bundle size (FontAwesome not loaded)
  - Foundation for future optimizations
