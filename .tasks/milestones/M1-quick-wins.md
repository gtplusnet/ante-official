## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Code Splitting Breaks Features
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing before/after, gradual rollout
**Owner**: @jhay

### Risk 2: Lazy Loading Causes UX Issues
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Add skeleton loaders, test all dialogs
**Owner**: @jhay

### Risk 3: Removed Dependencies Still Needed
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Use depcheck, manual verification, keep backups
**Owner**: @jhay

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Daily Standup Questions
1. Which task(s) completed yesterday?
2. Which task(s) working on today?
3. Any blockers?
4. Current bundle size?

### Mid-Week Review (Oct 7)
- Review progress (should be ~50% complete)
- Adjust timeline if needed
- Update priorities based on findings

### End-of-Week Review (Oct 11)
- Final bundle size measurement
- Lighthouse audit
- Retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
- Prepare for Phase 2

---

## Deliverables

### Code Changes
- [ ] Updated quasar.config.js with optimizations
- [ ] Cleaned up package.json
- [ ] Optimized boot files
- [ ] Bundle analyzer integrated

### Documentation
- [ ] All task files updated with results
- [ ] Bundle analysis report generated
- [ ] Optimization guide for team
- [ ] Lessons learned document

### Metrics Report
- [ ] Before/after bundle sizes
- [ ] Before/after Lighthouse scores
- [ ] Build time comparison
- [ ] List of removed dependencies

---

## Team Communication

### Notifications
- [ ] Start: Notify team of optimization work
- [ ] Mid-week: Share progress update
- [ ] End: Share results and learnings

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new workflows
- [ ] Update PLANNING.md with actual results
- [ ] Update TASK.md dashboard

---

## Rollback Plan

**If Optimizations Cause Issues**:
1. Each task has individual rollback procedure
2. Git branches allow easy revert
3. Vercel allows instant rollback to previous deployment
4. Keep old build artifacts for comparison

**Critical Path**: Have working build at all times
- Commit after each successful task
- Deploy to staging before production
- Keep main branch stable

---

## Known Challenges

### Challenge 1: StudentManagement.vue (1009KB)
- Too large to fix in Phase 1
- Will address in Phase 2 (Component Optimization)
- For now: ensure it lazy loads properly

### Challenge 2: Multiple Heavy Vendors
- ApexCharts: 528KB
- Quasar: 495KB
- Both needed, can't remove
- Solution: Proper code splitting (TASK-003)

---

## Next Steps After M1

### Immediate
- [ ] Celebrate 30% reduction! üéâ
- [ ] Generate final metrics report
- [ ] Update TASK.md dashboard
- [ ] Plan Phase 2 priorities

### Phase 2 Preview
**M2: Component Optimization** (Oct 11-25)
- Break down StudentManagement.vue
- Optimize MainLayout.vue
- Implement virtual scrolling
- Add pagination to tables

**Milestone Owner**: @jhay
**Start Date**: 2025-10-04
**Target Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: üü° Ready to Start

---

**Notes**: This milestone is the foundation for all future optimizations. Focus on high-impact, low-risk changes. Don't over-optimize - save complex refactoring for Phase 2. Goal is 30% reduction, but 20% is acceptable if it means maintaining stability.
