## Development While Testing

Start the development.

Once you create the feature or fix the problem - test it using playwright. If there are problems fix it right away. Then test it again until the feature you created is perfect. This is the process when developing in order to make sure every feature created is working accordingly.

## Test the features you recently made if working properly

Test the feature you made if working properly - use playwright - make sure there are no console errors.  If there are problems fix it right away. Then test it again until the feature you created is perfect. Repeat this process until everything is working 100%.
