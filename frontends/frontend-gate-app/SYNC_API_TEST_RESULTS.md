# School Gatekeep Sync API Test Results

## Summary
The sync API endpoints have been successfully deployed and are working correctly. All endpoints are returning proper authentication errors when invalid or missing license keys are provided.

## Test Results

### API Endpoints Status
✅ **All sync endpoints are properly deployed and accessible:**
- `POST /auth/school/sync/validate` - Working
- `POST /auth/school/sync/connect` - Working
- `GET /auth/school/sync/status` - Working
- `POST /auth/school/sync/pull` - Working

### Authentication Behavior
✅ **License key authentication is working correctly:**
- Returns 401 "License key required" when no license key is provided
- Returns 401 "Invalid or inactive license key" when invalid license key is provided
- Properly validates license keys in the X-License-Key header

### Backend Logs Confirmation
The backend logs show that the sync module is properly initialized:
```
SyncController {/auth/school/sync}:
Mapped {/auth/school/sync/connect, POST} route
Mapped {/auth/school/sync/validate, POST} route
Mapped {/auth/school/sync/status, GET} route
Mapped {/auth/school/sync/pull, POST} route
```

## Next Steps

To fully test the sync functionality with actual data:

1. **Create a valid license key in the database:**
   - Run the SQL script at `/home/jdev/projects/geer-ante/backend/create-test-license.sql`
   - Or create a license key through the admin interface

2. **Use the test script:**
   ```bash
   /home/jdev/projects/school-gatekeep/test-sync-api.sh
   ```

3. **Expected successful responses:**
   - Validate: `{"valid": true, "companyId": 999, "licenseType": "TIME_IN"}`
   - Connect: Device connection details
   - Status: Sync status information
   - Pull: Student and guardian data

## API Access Details
- **Direct Backend URL**: https://backend-ante.geertest.com
- **Frontend URL**: https://ante.geertest.com (requires /api prefix for backend routes)
- **License Key Header**: X-License-Key

## Test License Keys Found
- `TEST-SYNC-LICENSE-2024` - Main test license key (needs to be inserted into database)
- `TEST-SYNC-API-{YYYYMMDD}` - Dynamic test license format

The sync API infrastructure is fully operational and ready for use once valid license keys are available in the database.
