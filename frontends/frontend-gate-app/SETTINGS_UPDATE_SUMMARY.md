# Settings Page Update Summary

## What Was Fixed

The settings page at https://gatekeep.geertest.com/settings has been updated to show dynamic license key information instead of static placeholder data.

## Changes Made

### 1. **License Key Section** - Now displays:
   - **License Key**: Shows partially masked key (first 4 and last 4 characters)
   - **License Type**: Shows the actual license type (e.g., "TIME_IN")
   - **Company ID**: Shows the company ID associated with the license
   - **Device Status**: Shows if device is connected and device name
   - **Full License Key**: Shows complete key at bottom (for debugging)

### 2. **Enhanced useSync Hook**:
   - Added `deviceName` and `isConnected` to sync status
   - Fetches device status from backend sync API
   - Updates automatically when sync status changes

### 3. **Improved Logout**:
   - Clears all stored license information
   - Removes cookies for proper session cleanup
   - Redirects to login page

### 4. **Real-time Updates**:
   - License information loads from localStorage on page load
   - Device status fetched from backend API
   - Sync status updates in real-time

## Testing

To test the updated settings page:

1. Login at https://gatekeep.geertest.com/login with license key: `WS1ZZCACR44I13BKFDTLGCBVQ286SYTN`

## Data Sources

- **License Key, Type, Company ID**: Stored in localStorage during login
