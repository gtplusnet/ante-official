# Z-Index Analysis Report for Multibook NextJS

## Summary

I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of all z-index values in the multibook-nextjs project. Here's what I found:

## Z-Index Hierarchy (from highest to lowest)

### 1. **Navigation (z-[9999])** - HIGHEST
- **Component**: `/components/Navigation/Navigation.tsx`
- **Classes**: `z-[9999]` on the main nav element
- **Position**: `fixed`
- **Purpose**: Main navigation bar that should always be on top

### 2. **Mobile Menu Drawer (z-[2000])**
- **Component**: `/components/Navigation/Navigation.tsx`
- **Classes**: `z-[2000]` on the mobile menu overlay
- **Position**: `fixed`
- **Purpose**: Mobile navigation drawer that slides in from the left
- **Note**: This is safely below the main navigation z-index

### 3. **Hero Content (z-[500])**
- **Component**: `/components/Hero/HeroSection.tsx`
- **Classes**: `z-[500]` on the hero text section
- **Position**: `relative`
- **Purpose**: Hero text overlay on the carousel background
- **Note**: Has `pointer-events-none` so it doesn't interfere with navigation

### 4. **Various Section Elements (z-10)**
- **Newsletter Section**: `z-10` on the newsletter section container
- **Features Carousel Buttons**: `z-10` on prev/next buttons
- **CTA Section Content**: `z-10` on CTA content overlay
- **Market Section Content**: `z-10` on market section content

### 5. **Background Elements (z-0)**
- **CTA Background**: `z-0` for background image containers
- **Market Background**: `z-0` for background image containers

## Potential Issues Found

### No Critical Conflicts
The navigation's `z-[9999]` is the highest z-index in the entire application, ensuring it will always appear above all other content.

### Minor Observations

1. **Hero Section z-[500]**
   - While this has a relatively high z-index (500), it's set to `pointer-events-none`, which prevents it from blocking interaction with the navigation
   - The `position: relative` means it only affects stacking within its container

2. **Mobile Menu z-[2000]**
   - This is high but appropriate for a mobile menu overlay
   - Still safely below the main navigation's z-[9999]

## Recommendations

The current z-index structure is well-organized and shouldn't cause any navigation overlap issues. The hierarchy is:

1. Navigation (9999) - Always on top
2. Mobile Menu (2000) - High but below navigation
3. Content overlays (500, 10) - For section-specific layering
4. Backgrounds (0) - Base layer

No changes are needed to prevent navigation overlap issues. The navigation will always remain visible and accessible above all other content.
