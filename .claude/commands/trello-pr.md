# Complete Trello Task & Create PR

Automated workflow to complete a task and create a pull request.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Current State
1. Get current branch name
2. Verify it's not main branch
3. Check git status for uncommitted changes
4. If uncommitted changes exist:
   - Show files
   - Ask if user wants to commit them now
   - If yes, ask for commit message

### Step 2: Find Associated Trello Card
1. Look for card in "In Progress" list (ID: 68de5fd2323f4388c651cdef)
2. Match by branch name in card description
3. If multiple matches or no match:
   - Show available cards
   - Ask user to select the correct card

### Step 3: Pre-PR Checks
Ask user to confirm:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met?
- [ ] Tests passing locally?
- [ ] Build successful?
- [ ] Code reviewed (if applicable)?

If any "No", suggest completing those items first.

### Step 4: Push Branch
1. Push current branch to origin:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin [current-branch]
   ```

### Step 5: Create Pull Request
1. Get card details (title, description, labels)
2. Generate PR title from branch name:
   - Format: `type: Brief description`
   - Example: `feat: Add dark mode toggle`
3. Generate PR body template:
   ```markdown
