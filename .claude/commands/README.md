## Creating New Commands

To create a new slash command:

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Add frontmatter with description and tags:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Brief description of what the command does
   tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
   ---
   ```
3. Write detailed instructions for Claude to follow
4. Document the command in this README

## Notes

- Commands are project-specific and checked into git
- Trello commands require MCP server configuration (see CLAUDE.local.md)
- Commands use natural language instructions, not code
- Claude interprets and executes the instructions when command is invoked

## Documentation

- **Main Project Instructions**: `/CLAUDE.md`
- **Local/Sensitive Config**: `/CLAUDE.local.md` (not in git)
- **Trello Workflow**: See "Trello Development Workflow" section in `CLAUDE.local.md`

## Support

If you have issues with commands:
1. Check that MCP server is configured correctly: `claude mcp list`
2. Verify Trello credentials in `CLAUDE.local.md`
3. Ensure you have GitHub CLI installed: `gh --version`
4. Review command documentation in the respective `.md` files
